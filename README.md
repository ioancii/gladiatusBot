# gladiatusBot

Made in order to automatize the web browser game to play itself while the user can not/does not have the time to play so that he/she won't fall behind other players.

Uses Selenium and the chrome webdriver with its designated path on the computer to search, use and access diverse html elements like buttons, links, draggable elements and so on.
 
The main goal of the script - to play the game in the absence of an user - has been achieved, but it is still a work in progress and I have a lot of ideas to add to it.
